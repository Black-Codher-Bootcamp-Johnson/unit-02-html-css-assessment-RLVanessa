            <p>Welcome! <br/> My name is Vanessa, I'm an aspiring Frontend Developer from Manchester and this page is dedicated to tracking my journey down the technology route. I've recently gotten involved in coding, my <strong>goal...</strong> to use the knowledge and skills I acquired along the way to create and bring to life a world of endless possibilities. With every line of code I write, I hope to take you along with me on my journey of self discovery.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Born in the DRC under the brutal regime of Kabila the Son, my early childhood was characterised by violence and political unrest that exposed me to the cruellest problems plaguing the continent of Africa. It was here that my passion for problem solving and being innovative was born because as a young African born in country writhe with corruption and poverty, wicked problems were a normal part of the world I grew up in. Moving to the UK at the tender age of seven years old gave me the opportunity to start over, it was almost as though God turned back the clock of time, and granted me a 're-birth'. <br/> My experiences in Congo and the UK paved the way for the developer I am today, as whilst Congo introduced me to tools needed to be aware of complex problems, the UK helped me make sense of how to use these tools. This is the inspiration behind my journey down the field of tech. The developer that I am today is the visual representation of my hybrid-identity as a young African displaced from the mother continent, a young Black British woman whose British roots have been forged within the struggles of the history of Black bodies and history in the United Kingdom.From the code I write, to the way I approach structuring my code, the language I use, all parts of it are my deliberate attempt to create a world that makes sense of the world I’ve lived and the events I’ve witnessed. Coding is the tool through which I’ve chosen to emancipate myself, a woman of colour, of rich history and deep wounds, in doing so I hope to emancipate everyone who identifies with my story.</p>
